import math

import random
import re
import sys

n,k = map(int,input().split())    
arr = list(map(int,input().strip().split()))
count=0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(1,n):
        if i<j :
         
           if (arr[i]+arr[j])%k==0 :
            count+=1
print(count)            

Explanation --> 

In this question we need to give the output as the number of the sum of two numbers from the given array is divisible by the given number.
So here i have simply used the two pointers
First pointer i and the other as j and two nested for loops and in that the if condition to check weather i<j or not 
In the next i have checked the condition of sum%k is zero or not 
If it is zero we will increase the counter and if it is not zero then we will do nothing 
And in the end wen will print the count.
