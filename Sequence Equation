n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int,input().strip().split()))    
ans=[]
arr1=[0]*(n+1)


for i in range(0,n):
    arr1[arr[i]]=i+1
   
for j in range(1,n+1):
     ans.append(arr1[arr1[j]])
     
for t in range(len(ans)):
    print(ans[t])   

Explanation -->

In this question we need to keep the history of y provide in the equaton.
Equation is p(p(y))
So lets take an example 
Let take the list 2,3,1
So our first step is to assign the each value with a number from 1 to n 
Like 1→2 , 2→ 3, 3→1
So we will do this we cant make the use of hashmap as we are not counting the frequencies here 
So we take a list of length arr1[0]*n+1
This means its an array or list filled with zeros and of n+1 size
List → 0 0 0 0
Now our second step is to map the values according to the positions like as follows
1 can be written as according to list 1→ p(3) 
Similarly 2 and 3. 2→p(1),3→p(2)
Now we are storid this values in the arr1
By
for i in range(0,n): 
              arr1[arr[i]]=i+1
Now the arr1 will fill with the values accordingly as i mentioned above
0 3 1 2
At 0th index no element has been there as in above steps i just justified the 3 values for the 3 elements of the list provided and they ar 1 2 3
Now in the next level we need to store p(p(y))
So it is being done by again taking afor loop 
Now this loop will run from 1 to n+1 as here we are not taking the first element in case as the first element is 0
for j in range(1,n+1):
   ans.appnend(ans1(ans1(j))) 

And we need to print the elements of the list ans 
We do it by again running a for loop 
Below id the code
