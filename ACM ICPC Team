In this question we need to provide the output as the team who knows maximum number of topics and the  team knows how many topics.
.Here we only have the topics know to the attendees 
1 represents the topic known and the 0 represents the topic not known 
So here we have taken  the input as the list where each element of the array is the binary string topic known and not known to the attende 
And here we need to form the teams of two 
.so we have taken a variable which will have the first attende and the variable b which is the second attende 
And then again a for loop which will run and check all the elements of the string if at least one attende know the topic then we increase the counter ans by 1
And all the teams are formed and have there respective atendes in a and b 
And when the ans is increassed by 1 and when it is out of the loop it will contain the total topics kow to the team 
And then we will make a list of ans which will contain the topics know to the each team 
So we use max function to take out the maximum value form the array 
And count to count the number of maximum elements in the array.
And return both the count and maximum value 


Code --> 

#!/bin/python3


import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys
n,m = map(int,input().split())
topics = []
for i in range(n):
    topic = input()
    topics.append(topic)
    
topics2 = topics 
arr=[]
for i in range(0,n-1):
     a = topics[i]
    
     for j in range(i+1,n):
        b = topics[j]
        ans=0
       
        for k in range(0,len(a)):
            if a[k] == '1' or b[k]=='1' :
                ans=ans+1
              
        arr.append(ans)   


ele = max(arr)        
    
print(ele)
print(arr.count(ele))
